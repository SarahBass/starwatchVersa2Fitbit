Description in Clockface Fitbit Gallery APP STORE:

A cute , animated star on your watch changes its background every day (365 days) of the year! 

Have fun with your Fitbit as this little star swirls around on your watch, and interacts with you all day.  The star brushes its teeth, eats healthy food, works out, and goes to bed with a little teddy bear based on preset times. The star also plays an instrument, plays soccer, sun bathes, reads, does math, calls friends, watches movies, and more. His daily activities are an example of healthy daily routines and change upon the hour. He may fall asleep if you are not in movement, but will wake right back up and start floating again. 

This clock also has holiday modes automatically set for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Easter,  Saint Patrick's Day, and more. It also has monthly changes, showing winter backgrounds during January and December, Spring, Summer, and Fall. It also has dozens of night sky and colorful backgrounds. These are randomly selected per day, so you should not get any repeats. 

When you reach your goal, the star will change form selecting randomly from a library of characters. There are also 5 bonus characters for Easter, Christmas, and Halloween. 

Additional Information:
Turn on heart, steps, active minutes, and calorie permissions or it might print "NAN" or "0" Which means it cannot access your data to determine the number.

# starwatchVersa2Fitbit
Versa2 SDK 4.3 

Pomeranian Watch animates only upon moving x,y,z sensors. Star watch animates smoothly, but drains more battery. 
It also operates by changing the whole png background to produce animation. 

This watch aims to be more space efficient by using animate to move images and by using jpeg backgrounds.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get my Vectornator svg files to work with fitbit studio, so jpegs will do for now.
